# FSD Practicals

This repository contains a collection of Full Stack Development (FSD) practical projects, each designed to demonstrate core concepts in modern web development using React and JavaScript. Each practical is organized in its own folder and follows a consistent, professional structure and design guidelines.

## Repository Structure

```
practical-1/
practical-2/
practical-3/
practical-4/
practical-5/
```

Each `practical-*` folder contains a self-contained project, typically with the following structure:

- `src/` — Source code (React components, hooks, utils)
- `index.html` — Main HTML file
- `package.json` — Project dependencies and scripts (for React projects)
- `vite.config.js` — Vite configuration (for React projects)
- `README.md` — Project-specific instructions

## Design & Coding Guidelines

- Minimal, clean, and professional UI (no gradients, limited color palette)
- Consistent spacing, typography, and component structure
- Responsive and accessible design
- React functional components with hooks
- Organized file and folder structure

## How to Use

1. Navigate to any `practical-*` folder for a specific project.
2. Follow the instructions in the project’s `README.md` to run or review the code.
3. For React projects, install dependencies with `npm install` and start the dev server with `npm run dev`.
